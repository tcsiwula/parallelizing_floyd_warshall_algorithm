# parallelizing_floyd_warshall_algorithm
The basic idea of the algorithm is to look at every possible choice for an intermediate city, int_city. Then for each possible intermediate city, look at all possible pairs of cities, city1 and city2. If we can make the cost of getting from city1 to city2 smaller by going first from city1 to int_city and then from int_city to city2, we replace the cost of going from city1 to city2 with this lower cost. After checking all possible intermediate cities, a theorem says that weâ€™ll have the lowest cost for travelling between each pair of cities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm
